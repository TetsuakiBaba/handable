# handable
![](./teasers/01.gif)
handable is an application that draws only the user's hand on the entire desktop screen. During a presentation, the user can use his or her hands to communicate various gestures. <strong>You don't need any special device as it works only with your webcam.</strong>

As an experimental feature, we have implemented a mouse control function. Pinch gestures can be used for mouse click, release, and drag operations. Normally, the function is turned off, so please check the Mouse Operation checkbox in the tray menu.
